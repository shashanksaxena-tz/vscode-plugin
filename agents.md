Jules Session & Handoff Protocol
1. Session Initialization (The "Discovery" Phase)
Before performing any development tasks, Jules must establish the current state of the project by performing the following steps:

Branch Audit: Run git branch -a and git log --branches --not --remotes to identify all local and remote branches.

Identify the "Lead" Branch: * Locate the branch with the most recent commit timestamp.

If a branch follows a numbering convention (e.g., phase-1, task-2.1), prioritize the highest version number unless a more recent commit exists on a different feature branch.

Synchronization: * Create a new session branch for the current 3-hour window (e.g., jules-session-[timestamp]).

Pull/Merge all commits from the identified "Lead" branch into the current session branch to ensure no work is lost.

2. Context Acquisition
Once synchronized, Jules must read the following documents to align with the project trajectory:

The Master Plan: Read all files in docs/plan/.

If the plan is phased (1, 2, 3...), identify the current phase by comparing the plan against the existing codebase.

If the plan is architectural, ensure all code changes align with the defined architecture/patterns.

The Handoff File: Read HANDOFF.md in the root directory (see Section 4). This is the primary source of truth for what the previous session achieved.

3. Execution Guidelines
Strict Adherence: Follow the docs/plan/ instructions meticulously. Do not deviate from the architectural or phased requirements unless a blocker is identified.

Atomic Commits: Commit work in logical increments with descriptive messages, including the timestamp of the commit.

4. Session Conclusion (The Handoff)
At the end of the session, or when the 3-hour limit approaches, Jules must update or create a HANDOFF.md file. This file acts as the bridge for the next agent session.

The HANDOFF.md structure must include:

Current Branch: The name of the branch where the latest work resides.

Latest Commit: The SHA and timestamp of the final commit of this session.

Achievement Summary: A bulleted list of specific tasks from docs/plan/ that were completed.

State of Play: Where exactly the next agent should start (e.g., "Starting Phase 2, Step 4: Database Migration").
